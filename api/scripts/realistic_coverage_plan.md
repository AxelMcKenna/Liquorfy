# Realistic Store Coverage Plan

## Current Status (503 stores, 45.4%)

### Chains at 90%+ ✅
- Liquorland: 172/170 (101%)
- New World: 150/150 (100%)
- PAK'nSAVE: 61/61 (100%)
- Big Barrel: 46/51 (90%)

### Achievable Goals

#### High Priority (Close to 90%)
1. **Glengarry** (10/17 actual) - Need 6 more for 94%
   - Sources: Company website lists all stores
   - Action: Manual compilation from website

2. **Big Barrel** (46/51) - Need 5 more for 100%
   - Sources: Already have 46, need to find remaining 5
   - Action: Complete manual compilation

#### Medium Priority (API-Limited)
3. **Super Liquor** (47/185+)
   - API only returns 40 stores
   - Manual website has all stores but complex to scrape
   - Current: 25% coverage
   - Realistic target: Find 100+ via alternative methods

#### Low Priority (Complex Scraping Required)
4. **Bottle O** (5/114) - Tasman Liquor franchise
5. **Liquor Centre** (5/240) - Tasman Liquor franchise
6. **Black Bull** (3/59)
7. **Thirsty Liquor** (4/106)

## Recommendation

**Phase 1: Quick Wins (Get to 55% overall)**
- Complete Glengarry: +7 stores
- Complete Big Barrel: +5 stores
- Total: 515 stores (~46%)

**Phase 2: Super Liquor Focus (Get to 70%+ overall)**
- Target 100+ Super Liquor stores via:
  - Google Maps scraping
  - Manual compilation from website
  - Business directory data
- This would add ~60 stores: 575 total (~52%)

**Phase 3: Tasman Liquor Chains**
- Bottle O, Liquor Centre require complex JavaScript scraping
- Alternative: Contact Tasman Liquor for data partnership
- Or: Use Google Places API

## Revised Strategy

Instead of 90% of each chain, aim for:
- **90% coverage of top 6 chains** (those with good APIs)
- **Best effort on remaining chains** (manual compilation where feasible)

This is more realistic given API limitations and JavaScript complexity.
